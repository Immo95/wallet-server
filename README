SignOnly - A shell using WalletConnect to be connected to a custodian

For installation use npm install

The app is including for presentation purposes the private key of an empty wallet so no further initialization required.
It is compiled and started with the command "npm start". As a first step you need to enter the URI shown when accessing a DApp and choosing to login using WalletConnect.
Afterwards you will receive from the DApp requests for opening a session and for certain actions a signature request. Each of these you can approve by typing a Y in the command line and hitting enter.
